Changes in 1.1.3 (2020-03-12)
+ Updates to Documentation

Changes in 1.1.2 (2020-03-11)
+ Fixes critical bug:
	o Removed the usage of the unavailable package 'eva', which caused builds to fail

Changes in 1.1.1 (2019-10-28)
+ P-value reproducibility feature:
	o Now using nextRNGstream to generate independent seeds for each gene
	o Setting the seed (with set.seed()) only in .testWass
	o Removed use of seeds and the seed argument everywhere in WassersteinTest.R

Changes in 0.99.5 (2019-10-14)
+ P-value reproducibility feature for the permutation procedure:
    o as described [here](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/1218#issuecomment-53710763), a seed argument has been added to the functions wasserstein.test and wasserstein.sc.
+ Fix:
    o Checks for the validity of the "method" argument in wasserstein.sc and wasserstein.test that have become unnecessary with the use of match.arg have been removed

Changes in 0.99.4 (2019-10-01)
+ Fixes: 
    o Fixed a bug in .wassersteinTestSp where the names in the output vector were changed unexpectedly and added a test for this bug
+ Bioc Review I:
    o vignette: Added SessionInfo() to each vignettes
    o vignette/README: Changed the install instructions
    o unit tests: removed unused and commented-out code
    o R: Changed to switch statements to dispatch different methods in wasserstein.test and wasserstein.sc
    o R: Changed the order of arguments in wasserstein.test and wasserstein.sc and added default methods
    o R: wasserstein.test.sp has been renamed to .wassersteinTestSp; wassersetin.test.asy has been renamed to .wassersteinTestAsy -> both are now private 
    o R/NAMESPACE: removed the previously private functions .fishersCombinedPval and .combinePVal from NAMESPACE by removing @export decorators

Changes in 0.99.3 (2019-08-30)
+ Fixes:
	o Fixed a bug in wasserstein.test that led to NAs during gpd fitting
	o Fixed a bug in .gpdFittedPValue that led to NAs during gpd fitting
+ Modified wasserstein.sc tests and added new tests to reproduce the bugs and challenge the fixes
+ Change in squared_wass_decomp: If the standard deviation of one condition is 0, quantile-quantile corelation is not computed, since the shape term would be zero anyway. Previously, NAs were produced in some cases.
+ Swapped 'true' and 'test' values in call to .relativeError

Changes in 0.99.2 (2019-08-27)
+ Changes to DESCRIPTION:
	o removed the "Maintainer" field in favor of "Authors@R" to address build warnings
	o Changed roles: 'cre' = Maintainer, 'aut' = author

Changes in 0.99.0 (2019-08-27)
+ Version Bump for BioC Submission
+ Vignettes:
	o Added introduction section and sessionInfo() to main vignette
	o Added link to main vignette
+ Code style:
	o renaming where possible to conform with BioC convention
	o file renaming to uniform upper camel-case
	o comments edited
	o additional helper functions introduced

Changes in 0.2.8 (2019-08-19)
+ R Code redesign:
	o new unexported functions to help avoiding repeats
	o Redesign of all single-cell methods as S4 methods that are also capable to take SingleCellExperiment objects as input
	o Bioc-style function naming implemented
	o Now using the cpp decomp functions instead computations in R
+ Output names changed
+ Descriptions changed to match altered code

Changes in 0.2.7 (2019-08-13)
+ Bug fix in interval table / wasserstein_metric causing wasserstein.sc runs to fail
+ Tests for that bug added

Changes in 0.2.6 (2019-08-08)
+ Fix in wasserstein_metric where a result was squared
+ Work on CPP implementations:
	o Rework on the quantile computation in CPP that now produces more accurate approximations
	o Removal of obsolete parameter "p" in approximation functions
+ Now using wasserstein_metric in two sample testing procedures

Changes in 0.2.5 (2019-08-06)
+ Fixing R CMD check size error by reducing package size: Brownian bridge
  distribution, used in the asymptotic implementation of wasserstein.test
  now is downloaded into a local cache during the first run of
  wasserstein.test. From there it is loaded in all subsequent runs.
+ Fixed Bug in wasserstein.test  

Changes in 0.2.4 (2019-07-31)
+ Added Vignettes for wasserstein distance, wasserstein.test, and wasserstein.sc
+ Fixed examples and unparsable comments
+ Adressing Notes of R CMD BiocCheck ...:
	o Removed use of 1:... in favor of seq() or seq_len()
	o Removed use of set.seed(), which changed the signature of testing functions
	o Using 4 spaces instead of tabs and multiples of 4 spaces for indentation

Changes in 0.2.3 (2019-07-29)
+ Adressing Notes and Warnings of R CMD check ...:
	o Reverted changes of BiocParallel from Import to Enhancement
	o Removed redundant imports of arm, eva, BiocParallel
	o Removed CITATION, as it could be formatted to satisfy the checks without naming a paper

Changes in 0.2.2 (2019-07-29)
+ Added this NEWS file for change announcements
+ Added a file inst/CITATION that is supposed to hold the citation (after publication)
+ DESCRIPTION file:
	o Title and Description improved and shortened
	o Added bioView Categories: StatisticalMethod, SingleCell, DifferentialExpression
	o Added BugReports and URL in DESCRIPTION
	o Changed the former Import BiocParallel to an Enhancement
+ Changes to NAMESPACE: 
	o Explicitly declare the functions that should be imported from the packages arm, eva, and BiocParallel
+ Changed all code files in the package to have max. 80 Character per line
