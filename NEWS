Changes in 0.2.8 (2019-08-19)
+ R Code redesign:
	o new unexported functions to help avoiding repeats
	o Redesign of all single-cell methods as S4 methods that are also capable to take SingleCellExperiment objects as input
	o Bioc-style function naming implemented
	o Now using the cpp decomp functions instead computations in R
+ Output names changed
+ Descriptions changed to match altered code

Changes in 0.2.7 (2019-08-13)
+ Bug fix in interval table / wasserstein_metric causing wasserstein.sc runs to fail
+ Tests for that bug added

Changes in 0.2.6 (2019-08-08)
+ Fix in wasserstein_metric where a result was squared
+ Work on CPP implementations:
	o Rework on the quantile computation in CPP that now produces more accurate approximations
	o Removal of obsolete parameter "p" in approximation functions
+ Now using wasserstein_metric in two sample testing procedures

Changes in 0.2.5 (2019-08-06)
+ Fixing R CMD check size error by reducing package size: Brownian bridge
  distribution, used in the asymptotic implementation of wasserstein.test
  now is downloaded into a local cache during the first run of
  wasserstein.test. From there it is loaded in all subsequent runs.
+ Fixed Bug in wasserstein.test  

Changes in 0.2.4 (2019-07-31)
+ Added Vignettes for wasserstein distance, wasserstein.test, and wasserstein.sc
+ Fixed examples and unparsable comments
+ Adressing Notes of R CMD BiocCheck ...:
	o Removed use of 1:... in favor of seq() or seq_len()
	o Removed use of set.seed(), which changed the signature of testing functions
	o Using 4 spaces instead of tabs and multiples of 4 spaces for indentation

Changes in 0.2.3 (2019-07-29)
+ Adressing Notes and Warnings of R CMD check ...:
	o Reverted changes of BiocParallel from Import to Enhancement
	o Removed redundant imports of arm, eva, BiocParallel
	o Removed CITATION, as it could be formatted to satisfy the checks without naming a paper

Changes in 0.2.2 (2019-07-29)
+ Added this NEWS file for change announcements
+ Added a file inst/CITATION that is supposed to hold the citation (after publication)
+ DESCRIPTION file:
	o Title and Description improved and shortened
	o Added bioView Categories: StatisticalMethod, SingleCell, DifferentialExpression
	o Added BugReports and URL in DESCRIPTION
	o Changed the former Import BiocParallel to an Enhancement
+ Changes to NAMESPACE: 
	o Explicitly declare the functions that should be imported from the packages arm, eva, and BiocParallel
+ Changed all code files in the package to have max. 80 Character per line
