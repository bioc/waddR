### Use Cases

The package `waddR` provides with three sets of utilities, for distinct use
cases, each described in a separate vignette:

* Fast and accurate 
[calculation of the  2-Wasserstein distance](wasserstein_metric.html)

* [Two-sample test](wasserstein_test.html) to check for differences between two
distributions

* Detect
[differential gene expression distributions](wasserstein_singlecell.html)
in scRNAseq data

These are bundled into the same package, because they are internally dependent:
The procedure for detecting differential distributions in single-cell data is a
refinement of the general two-sample test, which itself uses the 2-Wasserstein
distance to compare two distributions.
