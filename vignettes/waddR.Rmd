### Use Cases

The package `waddR` comes with three sets of utilities, for distinct use cases.
Each is described in a separate vignette:

* Fast and accurate 
[calculation of the  Wasserstein distance](wasserstein_metric.html)

* [Two-sample test](wasserstein_test.html) to check for differences between two
distributions

* Detect and describe 
[differential distributions in scRNAseq data](wasserstein_singlecell.html)

These are bundled into the same package, because they are internally dependent:
The procedure for detecting differential distributions in single-cell data is a
refinement of the more generalized two-sample test, which itself is based on a 
decomposition of the Wasserstein distance between two distributions.
